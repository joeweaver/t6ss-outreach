        <p>You're looking at the results of simulating a bunch of interacting bacteria growing and forming a <span class="tooltip">biofilm<sub style="font-size:70%;">&#x1F50D;</sub><span class="tooltiptext_l">a community of bacteria sticking together, often slimy</span></span>. We can use simulations like these to understand how different interactions between bacteria affect their <span class="tooltip">ecosystem<sub style="font-size:70%;">&#x1F50D;</sub><span class="tooltiptext_l">a community of organisms and the environment in which they live</span></span>.</p>

        <p>We'll be looking at a specific example of how bacteria can compete with each other, but we'll also be using to learn about:</p>

    <h2>A few questions</h2>

       <img class="rimage" src="images/questions-2519654_640.png" width=480 height=480></img>
        <p>Let's think about a few open-ended questions, just to warm up and  get you thinking.  If you've been asked to, please write down your thoughts.  But also, don't worry, these questions  are:
        <ul>
            <li> <strong>not</strong> marked for grades </li> 
            <li> <strong>not</strong> the kind with clearly correct answers</li>

    <h2>Tell me what you want, what you really really want!</h2>
    <div class="l100">
        <img class="rimage" src="images/grapes-3550742_640.jpg" width=480></img>
        <p>Imagine you're your favourite organism.</p>
        <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>What sorts of things do you need to grow and survive?</em></p>
        <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>In particular, what sort of things might <em>other</em> organisms also need, so you'll have to compete for them?</em></p>

    <h2>Rising up to the challenge of your rivals!</h2>

        <img class="limage" src="images/halloween-832285_640.jpg" width=320></img>
        <p>OK, you've probably got some idea of <em>something</em>  you'll have to compete for.</p>
        <p><strong>Q:</strong><em>Can you brainstorm two or three different strategies you might use to have an advantage while competing?</em></p> 
        <p><span class="tooltip">Want an example?<sub>&#x1F50D;</sub><span class="tooltiptext_r">Think about how plants want sunlight - one might spend a lot of energy growing more leaves to gather more light, another might use that energy growing taller so it's not shaded by competitors. </span></span></p>

    <h2>You can't always get what you want.</h2>
    <div class="l50">
        <p>One last question.<p>
        <p>The ecological context almost always affects whether a strategy is a good or bad. For example, spending energy conserving water is great in a desert, probably not as useful in a rain forest.</p>
        <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>When might your favourite strategy from the last question not be so useful?</em> (Maybe even a drawback!)</p>
