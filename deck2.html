    <h2>There's more than one way to compete</h2>

        Instead of growing faster, why not just stab your competitors? Even better, why not stab them with something covered in poison?
        </p>
        <p> 
        Believe it or not, this is exactly what some bacteria do, using something called the Type VI Secretion System (or T6SS for short). 
        They grow reusable nano-harpoons which they use to poison any other bacteria that are nearby.
        </p>
        <p>
        <em><strong>Q:</strong> Do you think this is an effective strategy?</em></p>
        <p>Let's run a simulation where both species grow equally fast but one has a T6SS and see what happens.

        <p>It looks like having a T6SS is a winning strategy in this situation.</p>

        <p class="question"><strong>Q:</strong> About how long did it take for their to be four times as many orange bacteria as green? <span class="tooltip">Answer<span class="tooltiptext_l">Between four and five hours</span></span></p>
        <p class="question"><strong>Q:</strong> When did the green bacteria fall to about 10% of the population? <span class="tooltip">Answer<span class="tooltiptext_l">Around 6 hours (easier to see in relative abundance graph)</span></span></p>
        <p class="question"><strong>Q:</strong> Can you think of any times where this 'poison tipped spear' strategy would be a bad idea? <span class="tooltip">Answer<span class="tooltiptext_l">There's lots of possibilities. We'll talk about one in the next slide.</span></span></p>

    <h2>There ain't no such thing as a free lunch (TANSTAAFL)</h2>
    <div class="l100">

        <p>
        One reason that a T6SS strategy won't always work has to do with a recurring theme in ecology: adaptations often have costs, so there's a trade-off. The previous simulation didn't make the 'stabbers' pay any cost.</p>
        <p> 
        In reality, the T6SS system takes energy (maybe a whole lot of energy) to maintain. That energy would otherwise go to growth, so the trade-off is 'be able to kill competitors, but grow slower.'
        </p>
        <p class="question"><strong>Q:</strong> What do you think would happen if having a T6SS harpoon meant growing 60% slower?</p>
        <p>
        Let's see what happens when we simulate that.

    <h2>Paying the trade-off: Simulation view</h2>
    <div class="l100">
        <p><img class="limage" src="./images/t6ss_70.webp" width=512></img></p>
        <p>The T6SS doesn't seem to be a winning strategy if it costs too much.</p>
        <p class="question"><strong>Q:</strong> What, specifically, about growing faster is allowing the green bacteria to survive? <span class="tooltip">Hint<span class="tooltiptext_l">Remember the T6SS uses tiny 'spears', so it only works when cells are close to each other.</span></span></p>
        <p class="question"><strong>Q:</strong> Do you think the population graph will show anything interesting? If so, what?</p>
        <p><span class="tooltip">Curious about the 'floating' green bacteria near the end?<sub style="font-size:70%;">&#x1F50D;</sub><span class="tooltiptext_l">The simulation edges wrap around, so the 'floating' bit is actually part of the large green 'tower' which grew across the boundary. </span></span></p>

    <div class="r50">
        <p class="question"><strong>Q:</strong> Do you notice anything interesting about which species was winning over time? <span class="tooltip">Answer<span class="tooltiptext_l">It seemed to go back and forth between orange and green bacteria.</span></span></p>
        <p class="question"><strong>Q:</strong> How long did it take for a clear winner to emerge? <span class="tooltip">Answer<span class="tooltiptext_l">Green became permanently dominant at about 15 hours.</span></span></p>
         <p class="question"><strong>Q:</strong> When did the losing bacteria reach a plateau in absolute abundance?  <span class="tooltip">Answer<span class="tooltiptext_l">Orange hit at around 11-12 hours.</span></span></p>
        <p class="question"><strong>Q:</strong> If orange hit a plateau at hour 11, then why did its relative abundance continue to drop? <span class="tooltip">Answer<span class="tooltiptext_l">Relative abundance depends on the total number of bacteria. Since green kept growing, the relative abundance went down.</span></span></p>

        <p class="question"><strong>Q:</strong>  Apart from growing fast, what's another way bacteria can compete?<span class="tooltip">Answer<span class="tooltiptext_r">Directly attacking, such as with a poison-tipped 'spear'</span></span></p>
        <p class="question"><strong>Q:</strong> Why isn't it realistic to think a competition strategy is always effective? <span class="tooltip">Answer<span class="tooltiptext_r">Most strategies involve a trade-off, which is a common theme in ecology</span></span></p>
        <p class="question"><strong>Q:</strong> Why isn't stabbing and poisoning the competition always effective? <span class="tooltip">Answer<span class="tooltiptext_r">It requires growing slower, and competitors might be able to grow to outside of stabbing distance.</span></span></p>
        <p class="question"><strong>Q:</strong> Why isn't just growing fast the answer then? <span class="tooltip">Answer<span class="tooltiptext_r">Growing fast has its own trade-offs</span></span></p>
        <p class="question"><strong>Q:</strong> Is the winner of a competition always immediately apparent? <span class="tooltip">Answer<span class="tooltiptext_r">No, sometimes the dominant species changes over time.</span></span></p>
